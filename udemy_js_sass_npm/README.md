# "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!"

Platform: Udemy  
Author: Jonas Schmedtmann

A very demanding Sass course, additionally covering topics such as BEM methodology and npm.

\*Due to the fact that the course was published in 2019, some information was no longer relevant.
For this reason, I decided to fix these errors myself:

1. Change @import to @use and @forward
2. Updating the package.json file
3. Fix smaller bugs

There is a [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) to the course.

As part of the course, I have completed 3 projects:

1. Natours - Learn about BEM, Sass folder structure and npm
2. Trillo - Flexbox
3. Nexter - CSS Grid
