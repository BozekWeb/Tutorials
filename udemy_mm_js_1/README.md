Platform: Udemy  
Author: Mateusz Maj

A extensive JavaScript course, covering the basics of the language, as well as more advanced topics such as: DOM manipulation, objects and using the API.

There is a [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-jedyny-kurs-ktorego-potrzebujesz/) to the course.

As part of the course, I have completed 8 projects\*:

1. Image manipulation
2. Text manipulation
3. RegExp and password validation
4. Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
5. Hamburger menu
6. Days and trivia
7. ToDo List
8. Weather application

\*Some of the projects were done 1:1 according to the tutorial, and partly I added some smaller features as part of the self exercise.
