# "[2022] JavaScript - Jedyny Kurs, Kt√≥rego Potrzebujesz"
A extensive JavaScript course, covering the basics of the language, as well as more advanced topics such as: DOM manipulation, objects and using the API.

As part of the course, I have completed 8 projects*:
1. Image manipulation
2. Text manipulation
3. RegExp and password validation
4. Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
5. Hamburger menu
6. Days and trivia
7. ToDo List
8. Weather application

Some of the projects were done 1:1 according to the tutorial, and partly I added some smaller features as part of the self exercise.
