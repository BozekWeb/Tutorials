# "[2022] 10 projekt√≥w w czystym JavaScript"

A extensive JavaScript course, covering the basics of the language, as well as more advanced topics such as: DOM manipulation, objects and using the API.

There is a [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/10-projektow-w-czystym-javascript-cz-1/) to the course.

As part of the course, I have completed 8 projects\*:

\*Some of the projects were done 1:1 according to the tutorial, and partly I added some smaller features as part of the self exercise.
