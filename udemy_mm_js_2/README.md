Platform: Udemy
Author: Mateusz Maj

A course in which I made 10 more or less advanced projects using JavaScript.

There is a [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/10-projektow-w-czystym-javascript-cz-1/) to the course.

As part of the course, I have completed 10 projects\*:

1. Text Finder
2. Bill Splitter
3. Form Validator
4. Magic 8Ball
5. Stopwatch
6. Notes
7. Exchange App - API
8. Home Finance
9. Counter App
10. ToDo List

\*Some of the projects were done 1:1 according to the tutorial, and partly I added some smaller features as part of the self exercise.
